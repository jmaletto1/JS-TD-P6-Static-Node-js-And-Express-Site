			"description": "Displaying large amounts of data, such as hundreds of user profiles, can easily overwhelm a user, which will most likely end up in them leaving the page. In this project, I have created a data pagination system that displays 9 users on a page, and displays a page navigation system at the bottom of the page, allowing users to traverse through the results set without being overwhelmed. This project also makes use of a search function, allowing users to find a specific result (or set of results) without having to crawl through each page.",

			"project_name": "Interactive Conference Registration Form",
			"description": "This interactive form makes full use of Javascript & DOM manipulation to allow a user to sign up for an imaginary conference. The form makes use of the preventDefault() function to stop the user submitting the form unless all of the necessary fields have been submitted. It also performs checks on the Name, Email and Credit Card sections to ensure that the provided data is valid. The activities section provides a total cost of how many activities the user has signed up for, and prevents them from signing up for any breakout sessions that clash. The form also displays a more streamlined version if the client has Javascript disabled.",

			"description": "This fun “Phrase Hunters” game is a stylish, Javascript-based version of the classic Hangman game. The game selects a phrase at random, and displays the characters behind covered placeholders. Users can then either type or click the letters on the on-screen keyboard to make their selection. If correct, the relevant letters are revealed on the board, and the chosen letter is blocked from being re-used. If incorrect, the player loses a life. The player either completes the phrase before using 5 lives, resulting in a win, or loses if all 5 lives expire.",

This project makes use of a public API to display 9 randomly selected users on to a webpage. The program allows you to search through the selected profiles, and launch a modal view of each user, by clicking directly on it’s thumbnail. This modal window provides far more detail on the selected user. From the modal window, the user can either close the window, or scroll backwards/forwards through the results.",
